<h2 id="business-problem">Business Problem</h2>

The education sector requires **data-driven strategies** to allocate resources effectively and design targeted interventions.  

**Objective:**  
> Identify which school, teacher, and student-level variables are the strongest predictors of Math scores and suggest policies to enhance student achievement.

<h2 id="dataset-assumptions">Dataset & Assumptions</h2>

**Dataset Overview**
- 5200 student records
- 17 variables including:
  - Student performance (Math, Language, Science)
  - Teacher quality (Training, Experience, Teacher-Student Ratio)
  - School infrastructure (Internet, Electricity, Toilets, Library)
  - Socio-economic indicators
  - Geography & Demographics (Urban/Rural, District)

**Assumptions**
- Dataset is representative of the student population  
- Score percentages are standardized across schools  
- Binary infrastructure columns (1/0) accurately reflect resource availability

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Duplicate check | No duplicate entries | âœ… |
| Outlier removal | Removed unrealistic Math scores (>100) and Parent Literacy outside 0â€“100 | âœ… |
| Missing values | Imputed using mean/mode | âœ… |
| Teacher_Student_Ratio | Corrected after filtering | âœ… |

**Final Data Status:**  
- Clean, standardized dataset ready for modeling

<h2 id="exploratory-data-analysis-eda-key-insights">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Key Insights</h2>

**Academic Relationships**
- Math & Language: r = 0.84 (very strong)  
- Math & Science: r = 0.78 (strong)  
- Dense score at 60% â†’ likely passing threshold

**Teaching Factors**
- Teacher training improves student outcomes  
- Teacher experience shows minimal impact (r = -0.018)  
- Teacher-Student Ratio not impactful (r = 0.003)

**Infrastructure Factors**
- Schools with Library, Electricity, Internet â†’ higher excellence rates  
- Internet availability is the single most influential factor  
- Schools lacking infrastructure have higher failure rates

**Urban vs Rural**
- Urban students consistently outperform rural students

<h2 id="research-questions-answers">Research Questions & Answers</h2>

| Research Question | Key Finding |
|------------------|-------------|
| What predicts Math performance best? | Language proficiency (r = 0.84) |
| Do teacher characteristics matter? | Training matters; Experience does not |
| Does infrastructure affect outcomes? | Yes â€” Internet & Electricity most impactful |
| Urban vs Rural gap? | Urban students perform better |

<h2 id="final-recommendations">Final Recommendations</h2>

1. **Increase Teacher Professional Development**  
   - Minimum of 6 high-quality trainings per teacher  

2. **Ensure Universal Infrastructure**  
   - Electricity + Internet for all schools  

3. **Integrate Literacy into Math Curriculum**  
   - Leverage strong Math-Language correlation (r = 0.84)
